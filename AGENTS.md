# AGENTS.md (lf-smart-paper-web)

## Scope
- This git repo root is `lf-smart-paper-web/`.
- Only edit files under this repo.
- Do not create, modify, or delete files in parent directories (`../`), including workspace root.

## Working Rules
- Run frontend commands from this repo root.
- Generated files (`dist/`, `node_modules/`) are local artifacts and should not be committed.

## Temporary Rule (Frontend Interaction Phase)
- This repo is currently in `interaction/UI-first` delivery stage.
- Prioritize interaction and interface confirmation before backend expansion.
- Keep frontend behavior demo-friendly if backend capability is not finalized yet.
- Remove this temporary rule once UI/interaction is confirmed and backend development resumes.
